## About

Go-credly written in Go (hence the name) enables users to obtain Certification Badges earned on Credly's Certification Platform.

All you need is your Credly `username` and _go-credly_ will fetch data from Credly's API, filter for active badges (can be overridden) and return either a Markdown or Standard Out.

### Use case

- You could use this tool to dynamically update a CV/Resume, Portfolios and Personal Websites using a Github Action, or just running the binary on a cron to fetch your credly badges.

## Prerequisites

- Credly Account with Public Visibility enabled.
